The function takes an optional argument telling it whether to index headers when possible or not.
Note that a header is a pair of a symbol and a string

Examples

(define encode (make-hpack-encoder))

(define headers 
 '((:authority . "127.0.0.1")
   (:method . "GET")
   (:scheme . "http")
   (:path . "/")
   (foo . "bar")))


(encode headers)
=> "A�\b�\\\v�p����@���\x03bar" 

(encode headers index: #f)
=> "\x11�\b�\\\v�p����\x10���\x03bar"


(define (decode (make-hpack-decoder)))

(decode (encode headers))

=> ((:authority . "127.0.0.1")
   (:method . "GET")
   (:scheme . "http")
   (:path . "/")
   (foo . "bar"))
